# Project Cost Breakdown

To keep the project transparent and easy to follow, the total cost has been split into **two sections** based on the project process.

## 1. Already Purchased (Before Design Review)
This section includes parts and components that were **purchased before the required design review** was submitted.

The misunderstanding was procedural:  
the project was expected to go through a **design review phase first**, with purchasing happening **after approval**.  
Due to this, some items were bought earlier than intended.

These items:
- Were purchased in good faith to start prototyping  
- Are documented here to clearly show costs already incurred  

This section exists for **transparency and accountability**. I do apologise not for doing this the conventional way.

## 2. Planned Purchases (Post Design Review)
This section lists the components that are **planned to be purchased after the design review**, in line with the finalized and approved system design.

These items:
- Reflect the current and intended architecture of the project  
- Are necessary to complete the system as designed  
- Represent the remaining expected project cost  

Separating these costs ensures clarity around what has already been purchased versus what is still required.

---

**Summary:**  
The cost breakdown distinguishes between expenses made prior to the design review due to a process misunderstanding, and the remaining purchases needed to complete the project following proper approval.
